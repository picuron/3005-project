# 3005-project

## Dependencies

### Due to a gem (Ruby dependency) we are using, this is only usable on Macs. We failed to get it to work on Windows, and it is untested on Linux. If you have trouble setting it up, feel free to reach out to me at my school email.

You must have Ruby downloaded: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

You must download the Postgres gem: `brew install postgresql`

You must download the PG gem: `gem install pg`

You must download the Faker gem: `gem install faker`

You must have a DB created on postgres, and have access to it's name, your postgres username, and your postgres passsword for connection within the application.

## To Run, go to the lib folder and type `ruby BookStore.rb`
